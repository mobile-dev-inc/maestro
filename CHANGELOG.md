## 2.5.1

- Fix `NoSuchMethodError` on Ktor server startup (login, studio, and cloud commands)
- Fix emulator discovery on Windows, restoring `start-device` functionality
- Improve Windows developer experience
- Improve device info help in `maestro cloud --help`
- Fix detection of successful emulator installation in `start-device`
- Improve CLI help for the `start-device` command
- Fail-fast on iOS transport failure instead of rethrowing raw `SocketTimeoutException`

## 2.5.0

- MCP server improvements
    - Consolidate `run_flow` and `run_flow_files` into a single `run` tool, mirroring the shape of `maestro test`
    - Drop 8 redundant tools (`tap_on`, `input_text`, `back`, `launch_app`, `stop_app`, `check_flow_syntax`, `start_device`, `query_docs`), shrinking the surface from 15 to 8
    - Add native Maestro Cloud tools: `run_on_cloud` submits a flow + app binary asynchronously and returns a dashboard URL; `get_cloud_run_status` polls status and per-flow results
    - Add `list_cloud_devices` and a `device_model` parameter on `run_on_cloud`, so agents can look up valid `{platform, model, supported_os}` triples instead of guessing
    - Add server instructions and a clean stdout handshake - MCP startup no longer corrupts the JSON-RPC channel, fixing `Unexpected token 'k'` errors on strict clients like Claude Desktop
    - Drop `use_fuzzy_matching` from the `tap_on` schema - the flag had no YAML equivalent and produced surprising matches
    - A compact JSON output by default
    - Upgrade MCP Kotlin SDK to the official 0.11.1
- Fix `--config=<path>` on `maestro cloud` for any filename other than `config.yaml`/`config.yml`, and allow configs to live outside the workspace directory
- Detect workspace config files by content (top-level YAML keys) instead of filename, so files like `platform_settings.yaml` are no longer mis-parsed as flows
- Fix workspace ZIP path traversal for single-flow cloud uploads - zip entries are now rooted at the deepest common ancestor, eliminating broken `../` segments
- Fix `--android-api-level` and `--ios-version` being silently ignored on cloud uploads
- Normalize resolved workspace paths so `..` segments collapse on zip filesystems
- Fix a file dependency resolution problem when users provided absolute paths
- Show upload progress in `maestro cloud` CLI output for the whole upload (workspace zip + app binary + mapping), not just the app binary
- Add a CLI warning when the workspace zip produced for `maestro cloud` exceeds 20 MB, since oversized uploads slow queue and run times across the fleet
- Replace Android TCP port forwarding with a direct ADB socket for gRPC - around 41% faster on a simple `assertVisible` flow, and removes the flaky forwarding thread that fought with Studio/CLI/MCP running side-by-side
- Fixes to cancelling flow execution when inside a long-running command
- Allow JavaScript expressions in the `timeout` field of `waitForAnimationToEnd`
- Add missing string-command config for `inputRandomColorName` and related random-input commands
- Detect Azure Pipelines as a CI provider (via `TF_BUILD`), so promotional messages are suppressed
- Populate the `text` attribute for `<textarea>` elements in the view hierarchy (web)
- Remove CLI-side `--app-binary-id` validation - server-side already handles it
- Remove the unmaintained `recipes/` folder; examples now live at https://docs.maestro.dev/examples
- Fix log folder name generation where outputs were being split across two similarly-timestamped directories, and extend `XDG_STATE_HOME` support to log outputs
- Fix `ToastAccessibilityListener` crashing Maestro when toast nodes have no text (Android)
- Add support for the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission on Android
- Fix XCTest UI-interruption preflight hang in the iOS runner, where alerts shown during app launch could freeze the test
- `retryCommand` now only retries on `MaestroException` and propagates other exceptions, instead of swallowing unrelated errors

## 2.0.1
Fixes:

## 2.0.0
Breaking Change:
- Updated java version to 17 better performance, security, and modern features. **If you’re still on an older version, update before using 2.0.0.**
- We’ve switched from Rhino to **GraalJS** as the default JavaScript engine. Expect **faster execution** and **modern JS support** for your scripts. [GraalJS Behaviour Differences](https://docs.maestro.dev/advanced/javascript/graaljs-support#graaljs-behavior-differences)
- URLs in the `appId` field are no longer supported. Flows must now use the `url` field in the YAML config for URLs.

Features:
- Added `setOrientation` command — adjust device orientation in tests (`PORTRAIT`, `UPSIDE_DOWN`, `LANDSCAPE_LEFT`, `LANDSCAPE_RIGHT`). ([Docs](https://docs.maestro.dev/api-reference/commands/setorientation))
- Enhanced MCP Integration:
  - More accurate flow path resolution
  - View hierarchy output size reduced by **50%** (faster & lighter)
  - `run_flow` / `run_flow_files` now support env variables & hooks
- Added  `--test-output-dir`  to specify where test artifacts should be saved. ([Docs](https://docs.maestro.dev/cli/test-output-directory))
- Added support for running entire workspace of **web flows** in a single `test` command.
- Allowed Keep-Alive from Server to support for persistent connections.
- Environment variables are now isolated between peer `runFlow` commands.
- Added timestamp to JUnit and HTML test report
- DataFaker is now available in JavaScript to generate random data for use in tests ([Docs](https://docs.maestro.dev/advanced/javascript/generating-random-with-faker.md))

Fixes:
- Fix CLI Cloud upload output
- Fix broken `maestro studio` command for web version of Studio.
- Fix **memory leak** for ios test runs that could cause out of memory issues on testing environments.
- Fix `maestro cloud` command when uploading files that have external dependencias (subflows, scripts and media)
- Fix disconnect in local iOS test executions when flow contains a large element tree

## 1.41.0
Fix:
- Resolved an issue where view hierarchy was incorrectly returned on full-screen apps or larger devices (e.g., iPhone Pro models, iOS 18). This affected selector matching for taps and assertions.
- Maestro now properly handles timeouts from the XCTest framework when the app UI is slow or too large. These are surfaced as actionable exceptions with helpful messages.
- setLocation now mocks all major location providers (GPS, network, fused). Also ensures proper cleanup when the driver shuts down.
- Errors when .maestro config file is misinterpreted as a test flow file.

Features:
- Platform configs are now supported via workspace configuration [(Docs)](https://docs.maestro.dev/api-reference/configuration/workspace-configuration#platform-configuration):
  * `disableAnimations` for both android and iOS.
  * `snapshotKeyHonorModalViews`: On iOS, includes elements behind modals that are still visible on modal to user but gets missing in hierarchy.
- Added support for selecting `select` tags dropdown elements in web flows.
- Debug messages are now attached to Maestro exceptions to help users understand failures faster.
- Added support for selecting elements using CSS/DOM query
- Added Maestro MCP server implementation to cli by [[Stevie Clifton](https://github.com/steviec)]

Breaking Change:
- `retryTapIfNoChange` is now disabled by default. It was causing side effects in some apps. If needed, it can still be manually enabled.
