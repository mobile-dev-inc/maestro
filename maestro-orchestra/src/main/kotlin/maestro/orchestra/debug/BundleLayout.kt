/**
 * The producer's private layout of the artifacts bundle: the relative paths core
 * writes, all resolved against the artifacts folder (the dir holding [MANIFEST_JSON]).
 * Module-internal on purpose — only the bundle's writers (the collector, the
 * generator, Orchestra's command output) need these. Consumers read each
 * artifact's location from the manifest's `relativePath` at runtime, so the
 * layout is no inter-module contract and stays here, not in -models.
 *
 * Layout under the artifacts folder:
 * ```
 * <artifacts-dir>/            ← the "artifacts" zip = everything core makes
 *   manifest.json
 *   commands.json
 *   logs/
 *     maestro.log
 *     device logs, crash/ANR  ← worker/cloud only
 *   takeScreenshot/           ← takeScreenshot command output
 *   startRecording/           ← startRecording command output
 *   screenshots/              ← step screenshots, step-<NNN>-<type>[-<arg>].png (action steps + final.png; failed step only when flag off)
 *   screen-hierarchy/         ← per-step view hierarchy JSON
 *   screen-recording.mp4      ← full-run recording (flag-gated)
 *   assertScreenshot/         ← assertScreenshot failure diffs, one PNG per failing assertion
 *   ai-analysis/              ← screenshots an AI command analyzed (with defects)
 * ```
