# pre-configuration that prevents Maestro flows from being blocked by:
#   - Chrome's first-run "Welcome / Make Chrome your own" UI
#   - GMS's "Google Location Accuracy" consent dialog (Android 14+ google_apis images)
#
# Both pre-configs are emulator/userdebug-only — real users hit these dialogs on their
# own devices and need driver-level fixes for them. This script is purely a CI bootstrap.
#
# Idempotent. Run after starting the emulator and before installing apps / running tests.

# `adb root`/`adb unroot` restart the on-device adb daemon, so the control connection
# frequently drops on the first attempt ("adb: unable to connect for root/unroot: closed",
# "device offline") on CI emulators — which would otherwise abort this script via `set -e`.
# Retry the daemon-restart commands, waiting for the device to come back between attempts.

# Pre-grant GMS "Google Location Accuracy" consent so FusedLocationProviderClient.setMockMode(true)
# in maestro-server doesn't trigger a system overlay during setLocation flows on the
# Android 14+ google_apis image. The flag lives in GMS's private content provider
# (content://com.google.settings/partner) which only `system` uid can write to —
# `adb root` (userdebug emulator only) gives us that. Real users on production-build
# phones can't root and will hit the dialog separately; that's a driver-side fix.
